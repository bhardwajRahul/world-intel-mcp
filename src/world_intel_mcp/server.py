World Intelligence MCP Server
==============================

Real-time global intelligence across 30 domains:
financial markets, economic indicators, earthquakes, wildfires,
conflict, military flights, infrastructure, and more.

Phase 1: Markets, Economic, Seismology, Wildfire (14 tools).
Phase 2: Conflict, Military, Infrastructure, Maritime, Climate (+10 = 24 tools).
Phase 3: News, Intelligence, Prediction, Displacement, Aviation, Cyber (+9 = 33 tools).
Phase 4: (reports removed — use live dashboard instead).
Phase 5: Analysis — focal points, signal summary, temporal anomalies, CII v2 (+3 = 39 tools).
Phase 6: Military & infrastructure intelligence (+6 = 45 tools).
Phase 7: Health, sanctions, elections, shipping, social, nuclear, alerts, trends (+10 = 55 tools).
Phase 8: Service status monitoring, RSS expansion (80+ feeds, 14 categories) (+1 = 56 tools).
Phase 9: Geospatial datasets — military bases, ports, pipelines, nuclear facilities (+4 = 60 tools).
Phase 10: NLP intelligence — entity extraction, event classification, news clustering, keyword spikes (+4 = 64 tools).
Phase 11: Strategic synthesis — strategic posture, world brief, fleet report, population exposure (+4 = 68 tools).
Phase 12: Extended geospatial (cables, datacenters, spaceports, minerals, exchanges), country stocks,
          aircraft batch, Hacker News, GitHub trending, arXiv papers, USA spending,
          NASA EONET, GDACS disaster alerts (+14 = 82 tools).
Phase 13: USNI fleet tracker, RSS expansion, report removal.
Phase 14: BTC technicals, central bank rates, trade routes, cloud regions, financial centers (+5 = 87 tools).
Phase 15: Business intelligence — forex (3), bonds/yields (2), earnings (2), SEC filings (3),
          company enrichment (1), macro composite (1) (+12 = 99 tools).
Phase 16: Vector intelligence — semantic search, similar events, timeline, vector stats,
          on-demand collection (+5 = 104 tools). Qdrant vector store auto-populates from all fetches.
          Collector daemon for 24/7 data accumulation. Enterprise-grade semantic retrieval.
Phase 17: Cross-domain analytics — cross-domain correlation, domain summary, trend detection
          (+3 = 109 tools). Historical analysis and early warning from accumulated vector data.
Phase 18: PDF/HTML intelligence reports (+1 = 110 tools). WeasyPrint-based multi-section
          report generation covering 18 intelligence domains in parallel.
Phase 19: Consumer energy signals (+3 = 113 tools). Retail fuel, residential natural gas,
          and electricity rates round out consumer energy monitoring.
Phase 20: Cited situation briefs and intel_daily_digest (+1 = 114 tools). Situation briefs
          now carry a numbered sources list and an honest cited flag; the new digest tool
          composes a cited markdown morning brief, degrading via data_gaps when the vector
          store is unavailable.
Phase 21: AOI geofences (+5 = 119 tools). intel_aoi_define/list/delete persist named
          point-radius areas in a dedicated table of the shared cache database.
          intel_aoi_brief composes a cited, radius-filtered view of earthquakes, military
          flights, wildfires, ACLED conflict events, sampled aviation, nearby static
          infrastructure, and news mentions for a user's own area, with data_gaps for
          domains that can't be scoped. intel_aoi_escalation reuses the existing hotspot
          scoring unmodified for a user AOI (#16).
Phase 22: intel_situation_brief (+1 = 120 tools). The cited situation brief (#15) is now
          reachable directly over MCP, not only through the dashboard: a bounded
          server-side gather of ~8-10 domains feeds the existing, unmodified
          fetch_situation_brief() (#18).
Phase 23: Geofence hardening + change detection (+2 = 122 tools). AOI bounding boxes
          split at the antimeridian instead of clamping (military fetches merge per-box
          with icao24 dedup; one-box failures surface as partial-coverage data_gaps);
          pipelines and undersea cables match on great-circle segment distance, not
          endpoints only. intel_aoi_update renames/resizes an AOI in place;
          intel_aoi_changes diffs each sweep against a stored per-AOI snapshot to
          report what entered and left the fence, with an explicit baseline first run
          and failed domains excluded from the diff rather than read as departures.
Phase 26: the 2,900-line registry/dispatch monolith split into domain modules
          under tools/ (12 modules, aggregated with an import-time
          TOOLS/HANDLERS parity guarantee) and shared infrastructure in
          runtime.py. Pure move: 128 tools, byte-identical definitions,
          identical dispatch semantics.
