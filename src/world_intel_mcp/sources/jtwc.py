"""JTWC tropical cyclone warning source for world-intel-mcp.

Parses the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's RSS feed at metoc.navy.mil.
No API key required. Complement to sources/cyclones.py (NHC): JTWC is
the US DoD warning agency for the Northwest Pacific, North Indian
Ocean, and Southern Hemisphere; its feed also carries a Central/Eastern
Pacific item that overlaps NHC coverage.

Feed facts, verified live 2026-09-01 against four active storms: RSS
2.0 with one item per basin group (guids NWPAC-NIO-WARNINGS,
EPAC-CPAC-WARNINGS, SH-WARNINGS) plus a TROPICAL-ADVISORIES item
listing the significant-tropical-weather advisories (ABPW10/ABIO10).
Storms live inside each item's CDATA HTML description as headers like
"Tropical Depression  17W (Saudel) Warning #42" followed by
"Issued at 01/2100Z" and product links; the HTML nests unbalanced
<p><b> tags, so parsing is regex-over-text, not DOM. A quiet basin's
item says "No Current Tropical Cyclone Warnings." — that is a VALID
empty result, not an outage. Item pubDates use a two-digit year
("Tue, 01 Sep 26 ..."); issued_at carries only day/time (DD/HHMMZ).

Positions, intensities, and forecast tracks are NOT in the RSS — they
live in the per-storm warning-text products this module links to but
does not fetch (one fetch per storm would fan out unboundedly).
