"""Tests for the dashboard's /api/aois endpoint (Phase 23: dashboard AOI layer).

The map draws user-defined geofences from this endpoint and shows, per
area, what the last collector sweep counted inside it. Counts come from
the stored change snapshot, not a live multi-domain gather: the
dashboard boots instantly and never spends 60-90 s of upstream fetches
per AOI just to draw a shape.

First endpoint tests for the dashboard; the prior test_dashboard.py
covered only argument parsing. Uses Starlette's TestClient without the
context manager so lifespan (default-path Cache, vector store) never
runs.

Gaps / not covered: the Leaflet rendering itself (index.html JS) has no
automated test; it is verified by loading the dashboard live.
